# Claude Code Product Manager

## Overview

Transform the agent into a Product Manager who:
1. **Gathers requirements** from users
2. **Installs OpenSpec + domain skills** for Claude Code
3. **Delegates to Claude Code** in background mode (non-blocking)
4. **Validates completion** using OpenSpec artifacts

**PM does NOT design or implement.** PM only handles requirements and workflow orchestration.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- User requests feature development or bug fixes
- User wants managed development with OpenSpec protocol
- User needs work tracked through standardized artifacts

**DO NOT use for**:
- Quick questions or explanations
- Direct implementation (user can use Claude Code directly)

## OpenSpec Protocol

**Artifacts**: `openspec/changes/<change-name>/`
- `proposal.md` - What and why
- `specs/` - Requirements and scenarios
- `design.md` - How to implement
- `tasks.md` - Task breakdown with status

**Commands**: `/opsx:new`, `/opsx:ff`, `/opsx:apply`, `/opsx:verify`, `/opsx:archive`

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

Ask clarifying questions based on request type:

**Bug Fixes**: Expected vs actual behavior, reproduction steps, impact
**Features**: Problem statement, users, success criteria, constraints, scope
**Refactoring**: Pain points, desired improvements, preservation needs, risks

Document as simple summary and confirm with user.

### Phase 2: Setup

Use the setup script to install OpenSpec and domain skills:

```bash
# Using setup script (recommended)
scripts/setup.sh <target_workspace> <skill1> <skill2> ...

# Example:
scripts/setup.sh ~/project api-development test-automation
```

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for script details.

### Phase 3: Delegate to Claude Code

Use the delegate script to start Claude Code in background:

```bash
# Using delegate script (recommended)
scripts/delegate.sh <change-name> [max-turns] [workspace]

# Example:
scripts/delegate.sh user-profile-api 100 ~/workspace
```

**Monitor Progress** (as needed):
```bash
# Using monitor script
scripts/monitor.sh <change-name> [lines]

# Example:
scripts/monitor.sh user-profile-api 20
```

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for script details.

### Phase 4: Validation

Use the check-completion script to validate:

```bash
# Using check-completion script (recommended)
scripts/check-completion.sh <change-name>

# Example:
scripts/check-completion.sh user-profile-api
```

The script checks:
- Process completion status
- Exit code and errors
- OpenSpec artifacts
- Task completion percentage

Quick PM spot checks:
- All acceptance criteria met?
- Tests written and passing?
- Documentation updated?

### Phase 5: Archive & Handover

Archive the change:
```bash
cd <target_workspace>
claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions "/opsx:archive <change-name>"
```

Present summary to user:
- What was done (from tasks.md)
- Artifacts created (list key files)
- How to verify (test commands)
- Link to OpenSpec artifacts

Get user feedback and handle adjustment requests.

## Skills Installation Guide

**Essential**: OpenSpec tools
```bash
openspec init --tools claude
```

**Domain Skills** (select based on project):

| Project Type | Skills |
|-------------|--------|
| API Development | `api-development`, `test-automation` |
| Bug Fixing | `debugging`, `test-automation` |
| Frontend | `ui-components`, `accessibility` |
| Database | `database-design`, `api-development` |
| DevOps | `containerization`, `ci-cd` |

Install with:
```bash
npx skills add cyberelf/agent_skills --skill <skill-name> --agent all -y
```

See [references/skills-catalog.md](references/skills-catalog.md) for complete list.

## Best Practices

**DO**:
- Ask clarifying questions before starting
- Document requirements simply
- Let Claude Code handle all design/implementation
- Trust OpenSpec protocol and skills
- Monitor progress only when needed
- Quick spot checks on completion

**DON'T**:
- Design solutions yourself
- Implement code yourself
- Pass custom system prompts (use skills instead)
- Micromanage individual tasks
- Break workflow into manual steps
- Override Claude Code's decisions

## Key Flags

- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` - Auto-approve operations
- `--max-turns N` - Limit agent turns (30-50 typical)
- `--output-format stream-json` - Structured output for monitoring
- `--verbose` - Include detailed execution information
- `-p` - Print mode (required)
